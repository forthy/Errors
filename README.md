Errors
=================================

Errors is an easy-to-use library written in Scala for providing immutable, lightweight, extensible way to represent errors in your project.

Example
--------------
Basically you create an ```Errors``` object with or without some errors, add/remove/check errors on it, return it from functions and methods and finally when you need, represent it.

See [**Sample.scala**](sample/src/main/scala/Sample.scala) in sample module for a solid example.

To-Do
--------------
* Add this project to a Maven repository so it can easily be integrated into other projects as a library.
